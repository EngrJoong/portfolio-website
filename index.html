    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Joong, and I have a degree in electronics engineering. I took a detour into the world of software and now I can't get enough of it. We only touched on programming in college, but something about it stuck with me. I often ask myself, "How does this line of code work?" or "Why does changing this break everything?" and that curiosity is what drives me to learn on my own.</p>
    <p>As a General Virtual Assistant, I do SEO work, gather data, and make changes to websites during the day. I use tools like Ahrefs, WordPress, SurferSEO, Screaming Frog, and others. But at night (or any other free time I have), I dive into code, working on simple projects, learning by doing, and getting closer to my goal of becoming a Software Engineer.</p>
    <p>I might not know everything yet, but I'm not afraid to start from scratch, ask questions, and keep coming back. I'm getting better at what I love doing and gaining the confidence to make it my job one small project at a time.</p>
    <p>â€” John Michael Oliver Borbe</p>
